- [Magic Temple](procedural-programming/magic-temple/)
- [Image Processing](procedural-programming/image-processing)


### Mini processor

Performs calculations using bitwise operations, such as AND, OR, and XOR, to manipulate individual bits in binary representation for faster and more efficient processing.

### Magic Temple

A program that encrypts and decrypts data using various cipher methods, such as Caesar cipher, Vigen√®re ciphere.

### Image Processing

An image processing program written in C that utilizes geometric transformations to draw and combine shapes.

- [Streaming Service Backend](object-oriented-programming/streaming-service-backend)

### Card Game Backend

Java-based backend program that manages and controls the game logic of a card game, handling player actions, card dealing, scoring, and other game mechanics to provide a seamless and enjoyable gaming experience.

### Streaming Service Backend

This streaming service, built in Java, was developed with a strong emphasis on scalability and was designed with the ability to add new features and upgrades during the second stage of development.
